Lyrics：The sun is shining, the day is brightening up, happy times are happy times are happy times are here. The sun is shining.
Description：The music features a group of female voices singing a melody in unison. The instrumental consists of only percussion drums, African percussion drums to be precise. A shaker can also be heard sounding on every beat. In the background one can hear water sounds. The overall atmosphere is cheerful and uplifting.
