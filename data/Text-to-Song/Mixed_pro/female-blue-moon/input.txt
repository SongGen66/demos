Lyrics：Sing at the moon and drive through the night.
Description：A blues rock song is being played. Containing drums that are playing a simple groove along with a blues bassline that is supported by an e-guitar playing the same melody. So does a piano just in a higher pitch adding harmony. The female voices are singing together. Then an e-guitar starts playing a little solo-melody. There are some airy background noises that seem not to belong to the recording. This song may be playing at a local car workshop.
