LYRICS：Hey, it's a beautiful day. Ain't no clouds in the sky. The sun is shining bright. Let's get up and fly. Come on and take my hand together. We'll explore the beauty of this world forevermore. We can go anywhere to the mountains or the sea. Let's start an adventure you and me. No matter what life throws at us. We’ll be by each other's side.
