Lyrics：I've come to talk with you again. because a vision softly creeping. Left it's seeds while I was sleeping. And the vision that was planted in my brain,Still remains with the sound of silence.
TEXT：A male vocalist sings this retro classic melody. The tempo is slow with a melodious electric guitar lead, soft acoustic guitar accompaniment and subtle bass complimenting the soft vocals and backup. The song is mellow, melancholic, pensive, insightful, euphonious, dulcet and soothing. There is a sound of static in the background. This song is classic Rock.
